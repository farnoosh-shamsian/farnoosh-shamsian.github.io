            Profile
             </h3>
             <p>I am a doctoral candidate in Germany specializing in digital philology. I have spent two years of my PhD in the Department of Computer Science and three years in Ancient History, where I had the opportunity to combine language pedagogy with computer science. Currently, I am in the last stages of my doctorate program, with only a few months left to finish my dissertation.</p> 
             <p>My research interests include digital humanities, classical philology, historical language pedagogy, translation alignment, and the reception of ancient Greek texts in Persian literature.</p>
